# PyPSA-Earth Visualization Dashboard

This repository houses a dashboard designed to visualize the model output of PyPSA-Earth. The dashboard provides insights into energy models and helps understand current energy networks and future scenarios.

## Data Sources

The visualizations in this dashboard are powered by data processed using scripts from the [jis-validation-repo](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/ji-gis-validation). You can reproduce the database using these scripts. A sample .env file is provided in the repository to help you get started.

## Getting Started

To run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Main Sections

### Home Page

The landing page of the dashboard providing an overview of the project and navigation to different sections.

### Now Page

This section visualizes the current state of the energy network and highlights key insights that can be drawn from the existing infrastructure.

### 2050 Page

Here we showcase the model's capability to estimate future energy scenarios based on given parameters. The visualizations help in understanding potential future states and transitions in energy systems.
