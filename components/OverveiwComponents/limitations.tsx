          <strong>Sector scope is limited:</strong> Only the power sector is
          modeled, overlooking transport, industry, and heatingâ€”leading to
          incomplete decarbonization pathways.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No cross-border modeling:</strong> Countries are treated in
          isolation, missing the benefits of international energy exchange like
          load balancing and shared infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data quality varies globally:</strong> Inconsistent or
          unvalidated input data can result in unreliable outputs, especially in
          data-sparse regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited visualization coverage:</strong> Currently supports
          only 10 countries, restricting global insights and stakeholder
          engagement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cumbersome data extraction:</strong> Output data is not easily
          accessible, making detailed analysis and validation more difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Low reproducibility:</strong> Differences in data versions,
          environment setup, or configuration hinder consistent replication of
          results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Single-solution results:</strong> Optimization returns one
          feasible pathway, missing the broader solution space needed for robust
          decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PyPSA-Earth improvements:</strong> The model framework
          requires general bug fixes, feature and and modularity improvements,
          as well as documenation updates.
