          <strong>Sector scope is limited:</strong> Only the power sector is
          modeled, overlooking transport, industry, and heatingâ€”leading to
          incomplete decarbonization pathways.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No cross-border modeling:</strong> Countries are treated in
          isolation, missing the benefits of international energy exchange like
          load balancing and shared infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Only single weather-year:</strong> The model uses a single
          weather year, which may lead to over- or underestimation of
          generation and storage needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited data validation:</strong>: A general data extraction workflow used without regional-specific
          adjustments which can result in unreliable outputs, especially in data-sparse regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited visualization coverage:</strong> Currently supports
          only 9 countries, restricting global insights and stakeholder
          engagement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cumbersome data extraction:</strong> Output data is not easily
          accessible, making detailed analysis and validation more difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Low reproducibility:</strong> The entry barrier arises from a specialized skill set required to build and run
          a model which hinder consistent replication of results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simplistic optimization:</strong> An analysis returns only one
          a single pathway, missing the broader solution space needed for robust
          decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PyPSA-Earth improvements:</strong> The model framework
requires regional-focused improvements in data processing  to increase the overall accuracy
          <strong>Overlooking Distribution Grids:</strong> Transmission grid only considered
          which may lead to underestimating the costs and efforts
