        We are actively seeking financial support to refine the application,
        address current limitations, and unlock its full potential for global
        energy planning — empowering researchers, policymakers, and energy
        technology providers with actionable insights.

        If you're a software developer or energy modeller, contributing to or
        building upon open-source tools and open data platforms is incredibly
        valuable. This application is built using <strong>
          PyPSA
        </strong> framework and <strong>PyPSA-Earth</strong> model, both open-source and fully reproducible.
        <br />
        <br />
        The entire application is open-source — we invite you to reuse it,
        contribute to it, and help make it better!
