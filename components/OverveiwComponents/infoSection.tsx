          We took our expertise in energy system modelling and calculated 2050 scenarios for various countries,
          while ensuring the constraint of zero COâ‚‚ emissions is kept.
          All our work for this project is open-source and reproducable, a habit we've had for years.
          Reach out if you're interested in our open-source model.
